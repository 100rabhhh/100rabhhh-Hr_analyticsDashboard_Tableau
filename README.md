           Male: 87 (13.50%)
•	Attrition by Age Group: Displayed for different age bins.
•	Department-wise Attrition: Visualizes attrition rates across various departments, highlighting areas with higher turnover.

3.	Employee Count by Job Role:
Distribution of employees across different job roles and their satisfaction ratings.

4.	Attrition by Education Field:
Attrition rates segmented by different fields of education such as Life Sciences, Medical, Marketing, Technical Degree, and Human Resources.

Steps Taken:
1.	Data Preparation:
Cleaned and structured employee data, ensuring accurate and relevant information.
2.	Data Import and Transformation:
Imported data into Tableau, utilized calculated fields for necessary metrics.
3.	Visualizations:
Created various charts (bar charts, pie charts) to represent key insights such as attrition by gender, age, department, and education field.
4.	Interactive Elements:
Incorporated filters and interactive elements for users to explore the data in-depth.
